## 🏛️ The Myth Behind the Game

The game draws inspiration from the famous Greek legend of **Theseus and the Minotaur**. In this myth, King Minos of Crete commands the architect **Daedalus** to build a vast labyrinth to imprison the **Minotaur**, a fearsome creature with the body of a man and the head of a bull.

As punishment for past conflicts, Athens is forced to send seven young men and seven young women into the labyrinth every nine years as a sacrifice to the beast. Determined to end this cycle, **Theseus**, prince of Athens, volunteers to enter the maze and kill the Minotaur.

Before he enters, he is aided by **Ariadne**, daughter of King Minos, who gives him a **ball of thread** so he can retrace his steps. With her help, Theseus navigates the maze, slays the Minotaur, and escapes—emerging as a hero.

## 🕹️ How to Play

### With Motion Tracking (FuBIntLab)
- Designed for use in a **motion tracking room**.
- Players physically move around the space; their in-game characters mirror their motion.
- Swing the tracker **horizontally at high speed** to throw rocks in the final boss fight.

### On a Computer (No Tracking)
- Fully playable with keyboard:
  - **WASD** – Move character.
  - **1 / 2** – Switch control between Theseus and Ariadne.
  - **Spacebar** – Throw rocks during the boss fight.
- Rocks are limited—use them strategically.
- For first-time players, **Easy Mode** is recommended due to challenging aiming mechanics.
