# The Labyrinth of Crete

An **interactive cooperative maze game** built in Unity, where two players step into the mythic roles of **Theseus** and **Ariadne**. Collaborate, solve puzzles, and face the legendary **Minotaur** in the heart of the labyrinth.

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the *Interactive Systems* subject. It combines **team-based gameplay**, **puzzle-solving mechanics**, and an **action-based boss fight** in a mythological setting. Players must rely on communication and coordination to survive the maze and defeat the monster.

## The Myth Behind the Game

The game is based on the **Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur**. According to the legend, the hero Theseus enters the labyrinth to slay the Minotaur, a monstrous creature confined at its center. With the help of Ariadne and a ball of thread, he navigates the maze and defeats the beast.
